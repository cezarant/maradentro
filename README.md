Along of 2008 year, i have a dream to make a music that, represent my emotions about  "Mar Adentro" Film.

I call my friends, record the instruments, but anybody knows how sing. 
We try, but can't do it. 

Now, 11 after i have this idea: put the complete project in github and wait some musician to fork and improve my song. 

Do you like to try? 

The proccess is simple: download the Sony ACID, clone the project, overwrite some track (bass, guittar, organ) and push. 
Just it...
